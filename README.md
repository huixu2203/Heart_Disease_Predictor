# Heart_Disease_Predictor
The model uses logistic regression to predict whether a person has heart disease or not.

## About:

1. We will check for null or missing data, but there is not a single missing or null piece of data in our data set.
2. We can also count the 1's (person has a heart disease) and 0's (pearson doesn't have a heart disease) in the target column. The data is balanced and not biassed, which is a good thing for our prediction.
3. Then we will use a logistic regression model to train our model.
4. Then we check the accuracy score, which is coming out to be approx. 85% for training data.
5. And the accuracy score for test data is coming out to be approx. 82%, which is a good one.

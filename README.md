# Heart_Disease_Predictor
The model uses Logistic regression to predict weather a person has heart disease or not.

## About:

1. We will check for the null or missing data, but there is not a single missing or nul data in our data set.
2. We can also count fot the 1's(person has a heart disease) and 0's(pearson doesn't have a heart disease) in the target column, The data is balanced and not biased, which is a good thing for our prediction.
3. Then we will use logistic regression model to train our model.
4. Then we check the accuracy score, which is comming out to be approx 85% for training data.
5. And accuracy score for test data is cooming out to be approx 82%, which is a gooda one.
